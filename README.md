Synopsis
--

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import moznion.net.mysql.namelocker.NameLockManager;
import moznion.net.mysql.namelocker.LockStatus;

Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/table_name", "", "");
try (NameLockManager manager = new NameLockManager(connection, "lock-lock")) {
    LockStatus status = manager.getLock(10);

    /*
     * do something here
     */

} // lock will be released automatically when it escapes this scope
```

Description
--

This package is port of [Mysql::NameLocker](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mysql::NameLocker) from Perl to Java.

Note
--

Obtained lock will be release automatically when it escapes scope of try-with-resources, because `NameLockManager` implements `AutoCloseable`.

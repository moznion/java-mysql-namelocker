Synopsis
--

```java
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import net.moznion.mysql.namelocker.NameLocker;

Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:mysql://localhost/table_name", "", "");
try (NameLocker locker = new NameLocker(connection, "lock-name", 10)) {
    /*
     * getting named lock
     * do something here
     */
} // lock will be released automatically when it escapes this scope
```

Description
--

mysql-namelocker provides safely MySQL named locks.

A locks is created when you instantiate (it uses [GET\_LOCK(str, timeout)](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_get-lock)) and it is automatically released (it uses [RELEASE\_LOCK(str)](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/miscellaneous-functions.html#function_release-lock)) when it leaves try-with-resources statement because `NameLocker` implements `AutoCloseable`.

This package is port of [Mysql::NameLocker](https://metacpan.org/pod/Mysql::NameLocker) from Perl to Java.
